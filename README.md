# SIEM - Chronicle

**SIEM** (Security Information and Event Management) is an application that collects, aggregates, and analyzes log data to monitor critical activities within an organization.

**Chronicle** is a cloud-based SIEM platform built on Googleâ€™s core infrastructure. It allows enterprises to securely retain, analyze, and search massive amounts of security and network telemetry.

## Overview

In Chronicle, security analysts can search for events using the search field. Procedural Filtering allows users to apply filters to refine search results further, such as including or excluding specific event types or log sources. Additionally, Chronicle supports YARA-L, a specialized language used to create rules for searching through ingested log data.

There are two primary search modes in Chronicle:

- **Unified Data Model (UDM) Search**: The default search mode in Chronicle, UDM Search queries data that has been ingested, parsed, and normalized, making searches faster due to the indexed and structured data.
- **Raw Log Search**: This mode searches through unparsed, raw logs. While more flexible in terms of data points you can query (e.g., usernames, filenames, hashes), it is slower than UDM Search. Regular expressions can also be used to match specific patterns.

## Scenario

You are a security analyst at a financial services company. An alert is raised indicating that an employee received a phishing email. Upon reviewing the alert, you identify a suspicious domain in the email body: `signin.office365x24.com`. Your task is to investigate whether other employees received similar emails, whether anyone visited the domain, and determine any further threats. You will use [Chronicle](https://demo.backstory.chronicle.security/?warstory=) to investigate this domain.

## Expectations

- Access threat intelligence reports on the domain.
- Identify which assets accessed the domain.
- Evaluate the HTTP events associated with the domain.
- Determine which assets submitted login information to the domain.
- Identify any additional related domains.

## Step-by-Step

### 1. Launch Chronicle

- Access your Chronicle account.

### 2. Perform a Domain Search

- In the search bar, type `signin.office365x24.com` and click **Search**. Under `DOMAINS`, select `signin.office365x24.com` to view the results. The following are key points from the legacy view, VirusTotal (VT) integration, and the IP address `40.100.174.34`:
